# Captum-Attribution-Metrics-Analysis
This repository contains a Python script that uses the Captum library to perform an initial analysis of various attribution methods on a ResNet18 model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It evaluates and compares the performance of different interpretability techniques through infidelity and sensitivity metrics.
